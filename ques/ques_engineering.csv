"For Type X transactions, the system stores the transaction as a type X record but only if there is a Type Y record with the same key value. Otherwise the system writes out an error line. If there is a Type W record with the same key value as the type X transaction, the type W record is converted to a Tpe Z record."
"For Type Y transactions, the system stores the transaction type Y in the main file."
"For Type Z transaction, the system stores the transaction Type Z record but only if there is a pair of Type X and Type Y records with the Same Key value as the Type Z transaction. If there is no such pair, then the Type Z transaction is stored as Type W record but only if its date is before 2003. If none of these conditions hold, then an error line is output. The system ensures that no two records of the same type have the Same Key Value."

Read the following passage and answer the questions:
  The real crisis of our times is the crisis in management. I believe that the solutions to our problems lie in the development of the art and practice of management at all levels and in all facets of our national activities-from a small “bhat’s” tea- shop to the multifaceted international organization or the huge and baffling economics and social problems that are beyond the reach of either government or business acting alone.
" I strongly believe the private sector can contribute something far more important than even money, that is, management- management raised to a whole new order of magnitude- in the attainment of the new social and economic objectives put forward by our government."
" “But how do we do it?” The answer lies in developing a deeper sense of social responsibility on the part of our men in management. Management must act in concert with a broad social interest and serve the objectives of the society. The various socio-economics measures now being taken in the fields of licensing, price regulation and distribution of essential commodities etc. will not lead us towards attainment of new social objectives unless we ensure the benefits of these measures go to the ultimate consumer-the common man. This is possible only through right management, proper understanding and of course, above all, through cooperation among all concerned. "
"             Indian management has the skills, know – how and capacity to cope with new challenges. We start now. The opportunities are there if we will but see them, and see them quickly."

Prepare notes after reading the following passage.
"Men are not made in the same mould, like a lot of bricks; it would have ill-suited the wants of the world if it had been so. Consequently, even in the same country, men differ in disposition, and inclination and manners, and opinion, more probably than they do in face or form. And between the people of different countries the contrast is even more striking. We have then, also, different sentiments, different sympathies, different hopes, different ways altogether. It will always be so. So long as there are different minds, there will be different views on all matters that admit of opinion. So long as there are different degrees of latitude and longitude, as well as differing circumstances there will be different interests, different attachments and different habits. It behaves us, therefore, to cultivate a generous spirit of forbearance towards those, of whatever race, who may think differently and act differently, from ourselves. Even though we may be convinced that they are wrong. If we know them to be sincere, we should still bear with them and give them credit for their sincerity."
"This is the virtue of toleration or bearing with others when we may differ from them, or may not like their ways. Toleration should be shown in all differences of opinion on even the highest matters of life and death; and here it is of more value than anywhere else. When we cannot agree with one about a point of science, or philosophy, or faith, we can at least agree to differ from him, and there is an end. We must always remember that we are all likely to make mistakes and possess weaknesses, and that we ourselves need the same forbearance and sympathy. We are, besides, all of the same human brotherhood, and should, “like brother, agree”."

Read the following passage and answer the questions given below:
"Nanotechnology is science and engineering at the scale of atoms and molecules. It is the manipulation and use of materials and devices so tiny that nothing can be built any smaller. This is the scale at which the basic functions of the biological world operate and materials of this size display unusual physical and chemical properties. These profoundly different properties are due to an increase in surface area compared to volume as particles get smaller. Unwittingly, people have made use of  some unusual properties of materials at the nanoscale for the centuries."
" Experimental  nanotechnology didn’t come into its own until 1981, when the scientists in Zurich, Switzerland, built the first scanning tunnelling microscope( STM).This allows us to see single atoms by scanning a tiny probe over the surface of the silicon crystal. In 1990, scientists discovered how to use an STM, to move single xenon atoms around on a nickel surface. Engineering at the nanoscale is no simple feat, and scientists are having to come up with completely different solutions to build from the modern rather than traditional manufacturing techniques. Some nanomaterials such as nanowires and other simple devices have been shown to assemble themselves given the right conditions, and other experiments at larger scales are striving to demonstrate the principles of self-assembly. Micro- electronic devices might be persuaded to grow from the ground up, rather like trees."
" In the short term, the greatest advances through nanotechnology will come in the form or novel medical devices and processes, new catalysts for industry and smaller components for computers. In medicine, for example, we are already seeing research on: new ways to deliver drugs with contact lenses; the directing of drugs to tumours with tiny ‘smart bombs’; gold ‘nano-bullets’ that seek and destroy tumours; starving cancer with nanoparticles; diagnosing diseases such as Alzhemeir’s, monitoring health and fighting sickness with tiny probes; and growing new organs from scratch."
Questions: What is nanotechnology in general
In what way does STM help to support this technology?
Why is engineering at the nanoscale too difficult task to perform?
Do you think this technology is limited only with industry and computers? How?

Read the following passage and make notes:
"An upsurge of new research suggests that animals have a much higher level of brainpower than previously thought. If animals do have intelligence, how do scientists measure it? Before defining animals’ intelligence, scientists defined what not intelligence is. Instinct is not intelligence. It is a skill programmed into an animal’s brain by its genetic heritage. Rote conditioning is also not intelligence. Tricks can be learned by repetition, but no real thinking is involved. Cuing in which animals learn to do or not to do certain things by following outside signals, does not demonstrate intelligence. Scientists believe that insight, the ability to use tools, and communication using human language are all effective measures of the mental ability of animals. When judging animal intelligence, scientists look for insight, which they define as a flash of sudden understanding. When a young gorilla could not reach fruit from a tree, she noticed crates scattered about the lawn near the tree. She piled the crates into a pyramid, and then climbed on them to reach her reward. The gorilla’s insight allowed her to solve a new problem without trial and error. The ability to use tools is also an important sign of intelligence. Crows use sticks to pry peanuts out of cracks. The crow exhibits intelligence by showing it has learned what a stick can do. Likewise, otters use rocks to crack open crab shells in order to get at the meat. In a series of complex moves, chimpanzees have been known to use sticks and stalks in order to get at a favorite snack-termites. To make and use a termite tool, a chimp first selects just the right stalk or twig. He trims and shapes the stick, then finds the entrance to a termite mound. While inserting the stick carefully into the entrance, the chimpanzee turns it skillfully to fit the inner tunnels. The chimp attracts the insects by shaking the twig. Then it pulls the tool out without scraping off any termites. Finally, he uses his lips to skim the termites into his mouth."

"Case Study: USPA and IRA Company A former programmer in Fort Worth, Texas, has been convicted of planting a computer virus in his employer’s system that wiped out 168,000 records and was activated like a time bomb, doing its damage two days after he was fired. Tarrant County Assistant District Attorney Davis McCown said he believes he is the first prosecutor in the country to convict someone for destroying computer records using a virus. Donald Gene Burleson, 40, was convicted of Charges of harmful access to a computer, a third-degree felony that carries up to 10 years in prison and up to $5,000 in fines. "
"Burleson planted the virus in revenge for its firing from an insurance company, McCown said."
"Jurors were told during a technical and sometimes complicated three-week trial that Burleson planted a rogue program in the computer system used to store records at USPA and IRA Co., a Fort Worth-based insurance and brokerage firm. "
"The virus, McCown said, was activated two days after Burleson had been fired because of personality conflicts with other employees. “There were a series of programs built into the system as early as Labor Day,” McCown said. Once he got fired, those programs went off. The virus was discovered two days later, after it had eliminated 168,000 payroll records, holding up company paychecks for more than a month."

Read the following  passage and answer the  questions given below:
"There is increasing evidence that the impacts of meteorites have had important effects on Earth, particularly in the field of biological evolution. Such impacts continue to pose a natural hazard to life on Earth. Twice in the twentieth century, large meteorite objects are known to have collided with Earth. If an impact is large enough, it can disturb the environment of the entire Earth and cause an ecological catastrophe. The best-documented such impact took place 65 million years ago at the end of the Cretaceous period of geological history. This break in Earth’s history is marked by a mass extinction, when as many as half the species on the planet became extinct. While there are a dozen or more mass extinction in the geological record, the Cretaceous mass extinction has always intrigued paleontologists because it marks the end of the age of the dinosaurs. For tens of millions of years, those great creatures had flourished. Then, suddenly, they disappeared."
"The body that impacted Earth at the end of the Cretaceous period was a meteorite with a mass of more than a trillion tons and a diameter of at least 10 kilometers. Scientists first identified this impact in 1980 from the worldwide layer of sediment deposited from the dust cloud that enveloped the planet after the impact. This sediment layer is enriched in the rare metal iridium and other elements that are relatively abundant in a meteorite but very rare in the crust of Earth. Even diluted by the terrestrial material excavated from the crater, this component of meteorites is easily identified. By 1990 geologists had located the impact site itself in the Yucatán region of Mexico. The crater, now deeply buried in sediment, was originally about 200 kilometers in diameter. This impact released an enormous amount of energy, excavating a crater about twice as large as the lunar crater Tycho. The explosion lifted about 100 trillion tons of dust into the atmosphere, as can be determined by measuring the thickness of the sediment layer formed when this dust settled to the surface. Such a quantity of material would have blocked the sunlight completely from reaching the surface, plunging Earth into a period of cold and darkness that lasted at least several months. The explosion is also calculated to have produced vast quantities of nitric acid and melted rock that sprayed out over much of Earth, starting widespread fires that must have consumed most terrestrial forests and grassland. Presumably, those environmental disasters could have been responsible for the mass extinction, including the death of the dinosaurs."

The information that is needed to accomplish these tasks is gathered through an assortment of sensors-touch sensors, sound sensors, and light sensors."
" Depending on what type of tactile information is obtained through these sensors, objectives of the robot can be met. A robot’s gripper could crush an object or not exert enough force to hold on to an object if it doesn’t have sensors to determine the amount of force needed. Microwitches are used in the form of touch sensors. They are the simplest form of sensors used for this purpose. To eliminate weight and space used for switches, LED/Phototransistor pairs can be used. “If you’ve ever been blowing, that setup should look familiar”(71)."
 The phototransistor is then interfaced to a computer or other type of controller. The pairs of sensors provide more than just a there/not there signal. “The amount of light that is reflected provides an indication of how close the object is”(72). This approach is patented by “Health’s Hero 2000” (72) and uses optical encoder disks. Integrated circuits that use “strain gauges and pressure sensitive pain” (72) are yet another way to detect the amount of force applied to an object.
" All of these different methods of allowing a robot to interface will the real world “comprise a field of inquiry that is as large as robotics itself” (72). Thus, the above mentioned tactile sensing devices constitute an important part of successful robotics.   "

Read the following passage and answer the given questions:
"  We have invented different types of things for our comfort. The first man-made plastic was created by Alexander Parkes, who publicly demonstrated it at 1862 Great International Exhibition in London. All the inventions have both pros and cons. If you look at the use of plastic, it is huge. Cons are way higher than pros in the case of use of plastics. A Plastic bottle takes almost one thousand years to decompose, and even during decomposition it releases toxic chemicals such as bisphenol A, styrene trimer and others. Bisphenol A is a chemical that damages the re productive system of animals. So, every piece of plastic produced and which is not recycled still exists."
"     Plastic waste kills about 100,000 marine creatures every year. Most of them mistake plastic bags for food and therefore are dying. Once the plastic kills an animal it again comes back to environment to kill more animals. The estimated figure suggests that 14 billion pounds of plastic waste is dumped in the ocean every year.  So, are we really that selfish to let 100,000 marine animals die every year for our comfort and remain addictive to the use of plastics? Because of our ignorance about plastic, it could cause greater harm to the whole human race by causing different types of diseases and also the environmental impact of plastic, which is still unknown. Ethylene oxide, xylene and benzene are some of the chemical toxins present in plastic, which have miserable effects on the environment. This is an awareness point about the relationship we have with the plastic. We really can't beat the plastic as it takes so long to decompose, and while it's in use it also leads to different types of diseases such as cancer because of the use of substances like benzene and vinyl chloride."
"    The energy consumed in the life cycle of one plastic bag is estimated to be equivalent to 13.8 m.l. of crude oil, when gas, oil and coal are used to produce plastic bags, they emit dangerous greenhouse gases. Large amounts of plastic and dump  in landfill also cause a significant source of greenhouse gases. As plastic is a non-biodegradable substance composed of toxic chemicals. It pollutes earth, air and water. "
"    So, could it really be the worst invention? Time will probably have better answers for this. I think it is not who will eliminate who, but finding the right solution is the answer. We should look for alternative to plastic bags. The best alternative would be to use it over and over again and again. What I meant about recycling is that it would be the best alternative to plastic, so at the end of the day it may not be required to produce any more plastic substance."
"Questions: What serious effect does the plastic cause, during its decomposition?"
Why is the point of an awareness very sensitive about the use of plastic??
"How has plastic been the main cause of the pollution of environment, specially of earth, air and water?"
To what extent can we reduce the use of plastic? How?

"A black hole is a region of space from which nothing, not even light, can escape. The theory of general relativity predicts that a sufficiently compact mass will deform space time to form a black hole. Around a black hole there is a mathematically defined surface called an event horizon that marks the point of no return. It is called ""black"" because it absorbs all the light that hits the horizon, reflecting nothing, just like a perfect black body in thermodynamics. Quantum mechanics predicts that black holes emit radiation like a black body with a finite temperature. This temperature is inversely proportional to the mass of the black hole, making it difficult to observe this radiation for black holes of stellar mass or greater."
"Objects whose gravity field is too strong for light to escape were first considered in the 18th century by John Michel and Pierre-Simon Laplace. The first modern solution of general relativity containing a black hole was found by Karl Schwarzschild in 1916, although its interpretation as a region of space from which nothing can escape was not fully appreciated for another four decades. Long considered a mathematical curiosity, it was during the 1960s that theoretical work showed black holes were a generic prediction of general relativity. The discovery of neutron stars sparked interest in gravitationally collapsed compact objects as a possible astrophysical reality."
"Black holes of stellar mass are expected to form when heavy stars collapse in a supernova at the end of their life cycle. After a black hole has formed it can continue to grow by absorbing mass from its surroundings. By absorbing other stars and merging with other black holes, super massive black holes of millions of solar masses may be formed."
"Despite its invisible interior, the presence of a black hole can be inferred through its interaction with the other matter. Astronomers have identified numerous stellar black hole candidates in binary systems, by studying their interaction with their companion stars. There is growing consensus that super massive black holes exist in the centers of most galaxies. In particular, there is strong evidence of a black hole of more than 4 million solar masses at the center of our Milky Way"

Unlike them, travel networking websites users do not have pre-existing associations. Their only connections are the  discussion forums and the reviews and  ratings generated by other users.  As an evidence of the growing importance of online search and influence on travel behaviors, a survey of the hotel and  restaurant industry in Europe in 2007  concluded that 80% of UK consumers are  researching online before booking a hotel  and half of them maintained to have refrained from booking a specific hotel as a  consequence of a negative review on  TripAdvisor-like websites TripAdvisor, as said, is a website where  most information posted is autonomously  generated by its users. They post reviews, comments and ratings on a destination, a  hotel, an attraction or any other tourism related ‘object’ or service. Furthermore, it is possible to add multimedia elements (photos and videos) or travel maps of previous trips or take part in discussion forums, web-based  applications that allow users to post some  material and discuss some specific topic. The forum’s authors need to be registered; this  entitles them to create a profile containing basic data (nickname, residence etc.). As a new feature in TripAdvisor, launched  in 2007, is the Traveler Network. It allows users to add acquaintances to their travel  maps, by connecting to pre-existing ‘sources’  (e.g. email addresses, other blogs etc.). This  way friends may help planning a trip in a  more efficient way: a tourist can create a  network of travelers who can help by contributing their suggestions, reviews, advice. These linkages with people a user might be traveling with, or might be (even independently) heading for the same destination, form a real social network and is designed to save time on finding those who share travel similar tastes."

Tarrant County Assistant District Attorney Davis McCown said he believes he is the first prosecutor in the country to convict someone for destroying computer records using a virus. Donald Gene Burleson, 40, was convicted of Charges of harmful access to a computer, a third-degree felony that carries up to 10 years in prison and up to $5,000 in fines. Burleson planted the virus in revenge for its firing from an insurance company, McCown said."
"Jurors were told during a technical and sometimes complicated three week trial that Burleson planted a rogue program in the computer system used to store records at USPA and IRA Co., a Fort Worth based insurance and brokerage firm. The virus, McCown said, was activated two days after a Burleson had been fired because of personality conflicts with other employees. “There were a series of programs built into the system as early as Labor Day,” McCown said. Once he got fired, those programs went off. The virus was discovered two days later, after it had eliminated 168,000 payroll records, holding up company pay checks for more than a month."

"An excursion by the groups of college students is an educational excursion. In short, it is a formal visit to the historically, religiously and naturally important places. There are various objectives of excursion. It is generally organized once or twice a year to fulfill the curricula objectives. They may be a short hiking, adventurous trekking and a week-long trip"
"Although it is entirely an entertaining package for students, it helps to meet the set objectives of the curriculum. The students are taken to the traditionally, culturally and religiously important places. They visit the business trade centres, tourism centres, industrial places, the famous institutions and research centres."
"The excursion provides them the opportunities to work in a group. They learn to become social, helpful and co-operative. They are guided to write diary or expedition report. The excursion brings changes in their thinking and attitudes. It also helps to build up their confidence level. Most importantly they learn the importance of a group work. During the excursion period, teachers can study their students behaviors and attitudes as well."
"It may be to some extent expensive for some students. Therefore, the expedition cost should be minimized. In some cases, there is a fear of the accidents if a caring team is not pre-conscious regarding the expedition. The students can suffer from communicable diseases and a sudden change of climates. And they may learn bad habits if the teachers are not careful."
However; we should not forget that it is a part of education. The students shouldn’t miss this opportunity. The organizers should be much careful during the excursion period. The educational excursion should be according to the needs of the time and curriculum otherwise it may invite bad results as well.
How do the excursion change student’s mode of life?

"Chronobiology might sound a little futuristic – like something from a science fiction novel, perhaps – but it’s actually a field of study that concerns one of the oldest processes life on this planet has ever known: short-term rhythms of time and their effect on flora and fauna."
"This can take many forms. Marine life, for example, is influenced by tidal patterns. Animals tend to be active or inactive depending on the position of the sun or moon. Numerous creatures, humans included, are largely diurnal – that is, they like to come out during the hours of sunlight. Nocturnal animals, such as bats and possums, prefer to forage by night. Third groups are known as crepuscular: they thrive in the low-light of dawn and dusk and remain inactive at other hours."
"When it comes to humans, chronobiologists are interested in what is known as the circadian rhythm. This is the complete cycle our bodies are naturally geared to undergo within the passage of a twenty-four hour day. Aside from sleeping at night and waking during the day, each cycle involves many other factors such as changes in blood pressure and body temperature. Not everyone has an identical circadian rhythm. ‘Night people’, for example, often describe how they find it very hard to operate during the morning, but become alert and focused by evening. This is a benign variation within circadian rhythms known as a chronotype."
"Scientists have limited abilities to create durable modifications of chronobiological demands. Recent therapeutic developments for humans such as artificial light machines and melatonin administration can reset our circadian rhythms, for example, but our bodies can tell the difference and health suffers when we breach these natural rhythms for extended periods of time. Plants appear no more malleable in this respect; studies demonstrate that vegetables grown in season and ripened on the tree are far higher in essential nutrients than those grown in greenhouses and ripened by laser."

Read the following case study and answer the questions at the end.
"Therac -25 Accident After undergoing a lumpectomy to remove a malignant breast tumor, a 61-year-old woman was receiving follow-up radiation treatment to nearby lymph nodes on a Therac-25 at the Kennestone Regional Oncology Center in Marietta."
"On June 3, 1985, the patient was set up for a 10-MeV electron treatment to the clavicle area. When the machine turned on, she felt a  “tremendous force of heat……. This red-hot sensation.” When the technician came in, the patient said, “You burned me. Although there were no marks on the patient at the time, the treatment area felt “warm to the touch”."
"The patient went home, but shortly afterward she developed a reddening and swelling in the center of the treatment area. Her pain had increased to the point that her shoulder “froze’ and she experienced spasms. She was admitted to West Paces Ferry Hospital in Atlanta, but her oncologists continued to send her to Kennestone for Therac-25 treatments."
"About two weeks later, the physicist at Kennestone notices that the patient had a matching reddening on her back as though a burn had gone through her body, and the swollen area had begun to slough off layers of skin. Her shoulder was immobile, and she was apparently in great pain."
"In March of 1986, AECL received a lawsuit from the patient listing the hospital, manufacturer, and service organization responsible for the machine. Investigators pointed to the lack of a mechanism in AECL to follow up reports of suspected accidents."
"The Kennestone physicist later estimated that she received one or two doses of radiation in the 15,000 to 20,000 rad (radiation absorbed dose) range. Typical single therapeutic doses are in the 200 rad range. Doses of 1,000 rads can be fatal if delivered to the whole body."
"Eventually, the patient’s breast had to be removed because of the radiation burns. She completely lost the use of her shoulder and her arm, and was in constant pain."
"But the manufacturer and operators of the machine refused to believe that it could have been caused by the Therac -25. The treatment prescription printout feature was disabled at the time of the accident, so there was no hard copy of treatment data. The lawsuit was eventually settled out of court."
Questions: 
Who do you think are responsible for the accident? Discuss.
Knowing that the Therac-25 has software more responsible than the hardware in emitting the radiation; would you confirm that software is more risky than hardware? Give reasons.
Are you satisfied with the way the case was settled out of court? Why?
